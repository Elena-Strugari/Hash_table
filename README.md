# Hash Table – C++ Implementation

A simple hash table implementation in modern C++ that supports file-based data loading, insertion, and search operations.

## Features

- Custom `Table` class for managing hash entries
- Load input data from `date.txt`
- Insert new entries manually or from file
- Search for specific keys in the hash table
- Display all entries in table format
- Built and tested in Visual Studio with `.sln` support

## Technologies Used

- C++ (Standard)
- File I/O for reading/writing data
- Visual Studio `.sln` and `.vcxproj`

## How to Run

1. Open `hash_5.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Build the project (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Run the application (F5)
4. Modify `date.txt` to add more input samples

## What You’ll Learn

- Basics of hashing and hash functions
- Handling collisions
- Implementing basic data structures in C++
- Reading from text files in C++
